        <p>
            Ocean Star Restaurant is a Chinese and Filipino restaurant located in Garapan. It is one of my favorite
            restaurants becaus they have a wide variety of dishes to choose from. The food is always fresh and
            delicious.
            The prices are reasonable and the service is great. This is usually my go-to place when I want to eat out
            with my
            family.
        </p>

        <p>I love Ocean Star because of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Their burger and fries.</li>
            <li>They are affordable.</li>
            <li>Overall atmosphere and aesthetic.</li>
        </ul>
